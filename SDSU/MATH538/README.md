# Investigating fractals in Economic where Hurst Exponent as the financial indicator.

A final project for class MATH538: Discrete Dynamical Systems and Chaos @ SDSU.

## Motivation

This project takes a look into how fractals play a role in market analysis and the fractal properties in financial time series. We also explore possible explanations of this phenomena such as the Fractal Market Hypothesis and the Adaptive Market Hypothesis.

## Installation

We use `python=3.8.2` along with the packages:

- `matplotlib=3.1.3`
- `numpy=1.18.2`
- `pandas=1.0.3`
