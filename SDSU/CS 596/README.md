# Multiple models for classifying mushroom types

A small final project for class CS596: Machine Learning @ SDSU which uses Logistic Regression, SVM with multiple kernels and KNN for prediction. This project is something we mainly used for exploring the Scikit-learn library and learning to write a basic ML paper.

## Installation

We use `python=3.8.2` along with the packages:

- `matplotlib=3.1.3`
- `numpy=1.18.2`
- `pandas=1.0.3`
- `sklearn=0.23.0`
- `seaborn=0.10.1`
