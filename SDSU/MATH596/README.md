# Exciability in FitzHugh-Nagumo model and a brief look into its dynamics

A final project for class Math 596: Mathematical Physiology @ SDSU on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Due to some unfortunate events, the code for this project is no longer available.

## Motivation

As the Hodgkinâ€“Huxley has been the first most notable neuronal model for simulations that covers ionic current characterization, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a simplified version developed to faciliate the insights into dynamics of action potential generation that the HH model has. In this project, I cover 4 features that the model is able to retain along with different case visualizations.

## Installation

I use `julia=1.4.0` along with the packages:

- `DifferentialEquations=6.12.0`
- `Plots=1.0.12`
