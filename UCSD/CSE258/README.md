# Rating prediction of Drug Reviews with exclusion of text

This project is assignment 2 and also the final project of class CSE258: Web Mining and Recommender Systems @ UCSD.

## Motivation

There exist multiple papers predicting the user satisfaction
However, since the review text might not be available in real time, we would want to predict the user satisfaction before the user uses the drug, not after consuming it.

## Installation

The whole program is run on Google Collab so there is no need to install the dependencies. However, if you want to run on your local machine, you can find the first line of the first cell to the the packages that need to be installed. you can safely assume that the Python version is `v3.8.10`. In order to use the parts of the code, all you need to do is to uncomment that part and run it.
